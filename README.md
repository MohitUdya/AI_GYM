Overview:
The Enhanced AI Gym Trainer with Resilient Posture Estimation is an advanced fitness technology designed to optimize gym workouts and ensure proper posture during exercises. This innovative system integrates state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to accurately analyze and assess users' postures in real-time while performing various exercises. The AI component continuously monitors body positions, providing real-time feedback and guidance to users to maintain correct postures, reducing the risk of injuries and enhancing exercise effectiveness.

In the modern era, sedentary lifestyles and busy schedules contribute to declining physical fitness. Factors such as reliance on smart technologies, lack of time, and motivation hinder regular exercise. To address this, an application is being developed to cater to diverse needs:
Time-constrained individuals can achieve fitness goals in 20-25 minutes daily.
Affordability issues with gym fees are addressed through an AI-based online trainer.
Motivation is boosted by rewards for completing tasks, an engaging interface, and user-friendly design.
